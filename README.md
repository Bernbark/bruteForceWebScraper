# bruteForceWebScraper

This Web Scraper is designed to try to search for a phrase by going through as many links as it possibly can and saving relevant data to files for later review.

I made this so I could practice data collection as well as learn what information is available about my name online.

If you use this, do NOT use it for illegal purposes. It could be considered morally abiguous or even illegal to gather data on people without their consent. 

Some data gleaned by this scraper could be used for ill will and that is NOT the intention of this program.
